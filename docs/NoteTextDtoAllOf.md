# NoteTextDtoAllOf

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**IsOpeningText** | **bool** | If this is set to true, this text is meant to not be seen as part of the regular elements hierarchy but as a special opening text at the beginning of the project. For example, in GAEB XML, this would map to the GAEB.Award.AddText. Typically, such texts describe project-wide contractual definitions. If this is set to true, this NoteText should be placed at the top of the elements hierarchy directly in the ServiceSpecification.Elements group, otherwise it will likely not be treated correctly when exporting to GAEB. You can only set IsOpeningText or IsClosingText to true. | 
**IsClosingText** | **bool** | If this is set to true, this text is meant to not be seen as part of the regular elements hierarchy but as a special closing text at the end of the project. For Example, in GAEB XML, this would map to the GAEB.AddText. Typically, such texts are used to describe project wide finishing descriptions. If this is set to true, this NoteText should be placed at the top of the elements hierarchy directly in the ServiceSpecification.Elements group, otherwise it will likely not be treated correctly when exporting to GAEB. You can only set IsOpeningText or IsClosingText to true. |
