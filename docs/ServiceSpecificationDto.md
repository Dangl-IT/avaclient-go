**Id** | **string** | Elements GUID identifier. | 
**ProjectHourlyWage** | **float32** | The hourly wage that is used within this ElementContainerBase. Will be propagated to child elements. | [readonly] 
**ProjectTaxRate** | **float32** | The tax rate that is used within this ElementContainerBase. Will be propagated to child elements. | 
**ProjectPriceComponents** | **[]string** | The price components that are used within this project. They are ignored during Json deserialization because they will be set from the parent project. | [optional] 
**ProjectItemNumberSchema** | [**ItemNumberSchemaDto**](ItemNumberSchemaDto.md) |  | [optional] 
**Elements** | [**[]IElementDto**](IElementDto.md) | The IElements within this ElementContainerBase. | [optional] 
**ProjectLabourTimeLabel** | **string** | The label used in the parent Project to mark labour time, e.g. \&quot;Hours\&quot; or \&quot;Stunden\&quot;. | [optional] [readonly] 
**ContainsDuplicateItemNumbers** | **bool** | Indicates if there are child IElements that have conflicting, duplicated ItemNumbers or if any child ElementContainerBase elements themselves contain duplicate ItemNumber s. Will always indicate false when told to ignore duplicate item numbers. | [readonly] 
**ContainsDuplicateElementIds** | **bool** | Indicates if there are child IElements that have conflicting, duplicated Ids or if any child ElementContainerBase elements themselves contain duplicate Id s. Will always indicate false when told to ignore duplicate item numbers. | [readonly] 
**IgnoreDuplicateItemNumbers** | **bool** | Indicate if duplicated ItemNumbers within child elements are to be ignored. Will not perform checks for duplicates if yes. | 
**IgnoreDuplicateElementIds** | **bool** | Indicate if duplicated Ids within child elements are to be ignored. Will not perform checks for duplicates if yes. | 
**TotalPriceGrossByTaxRate** | [**[]GrossPriceComponentDto**](GrossPriceComponentDto.md) | Price composition by tax rate. | [optional] 
**IgnoreChildPriceUpdates** | **bool** | Internally used to indicate that a propagation is currently done, this is done to not recalculate every single result from a lot of changes when it is sufficient to calculate the total price at once. | 
**DeductedPrice** | **float32** | Net price after applied deductions. | [readonly] 
**DeductionFactor** | **float32** | Factor of applied deductions to the total price. For example, \&quot;0.03\&quot; means that a 3% deduction is to be applied. |

This property should map to \&quot;Bieternummer\&quot; or \&quot;BidderNo\&quot; in GAEB. | [optional]

**CatalogueReferences** | [**[]CatalogueReferenceDto**](CatalogueReferenceDto.md) | Referenced catalogues for this QuantityAssignment. | [optional] 
**PlannedExecutionStart** | [**time.Time**](time.Time.md) | The date when the execution of the services is scheduled to start | [optional] 
**PlannedExecutionEnd** | [**time.Time**](time.Time.md) | The date then the execution of the services is scheduled to be finished | [optional]
