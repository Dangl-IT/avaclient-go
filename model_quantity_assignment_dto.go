// QuantityAssignmentDto Quantity assignments are, in contrast to SubDescriptions, used to categorize parts of their parent Position. For example, it could be categorized by cost group - e.g. a Position describing concrete walls could follow the German DIN 276 Cost Groups Standard and specify that of the total 1.000m² wall, 500m² are classified as exterior walls and 500m² are classified as interior walls. They would then have different cost groups associated, e.g. for accounting purposes.
type QuantityAssignmentDto struct {
	// Elements GUID identifier.
	Id string `json:"id"`
	// The total quantity in this quantity assignment
	Quantity float32 `json:"quantity"`
	// These are Catalogue that are used within this ServiceSpecification. Catalogue references are used to describe catalogues, or collections, that can be used to describe elements with commonly known properties. For example, QuantityAssignments use these to categorize themselves.
	ProjectCatalogues []CatalogueDto `json:"projectCatalogues,omitempty"`
	// Referenced catalogues for this QuantityAssignment.
	CatalogueReferences []CatalogueReferenceDto `json:"catalogueReferences,omitempty"`
}
