// ComplementedByQuantityDto This class represents the linking to a complementary position with a specific quantity set. For example, Position 'A' could be complementing Position 'B' with a total quantity of 20 units
type ComplementedByQuantityDto struct {
	// The quantity that is complemented. E.g., if the base position has a quantity of 100 m² of a brick wall, a complementing position might be for 'walls that exceed 3 m height' and for a total quantity of 10 m².
	Quantity float32 `json:"quantity"`
	// This is the reference to the Id of the Position that is complementing. This means it does NOT reference the base position but the one that contains the actual addition.
	ComplementingPositionId string `json:"complementingPositionId,omitempty"`
